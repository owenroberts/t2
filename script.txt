hey, down here
hey, down here
help me get out of here
i've been in your butt for three days
i finally got out
do you know the toilet password?
type it in

that didn't work
i've been inside you for three days
try "butt"

that's not enough characters
try little butt

that didn't work either.
maybe it's something from your past.
try the name of the town where you grew up.

nah i guess it doesn't matter where you're from.
try your cousin's name.

try your cousin's dog's name.

try your cousin's cat's name.

maybe when you ate me you became me and i became you.
try my grandmother's name, "eugenia".

no? dangers.
well maybe it's the town where my grandmother is from.
try "new fartville".

my grandmother always talked about how she didn't have any friends.
maybe try "i am always alone."

my grandmother said that when she met my grandfather they fell in love immediately and she felt like she had finally made a friend.
but the seasons changed and he disappeared.
then she realized that that was normal.
everyone came and went.
they were only friends in spring.
try "spring".

oh that's not enough characters.
